// For this exercise, we will keep track of when our friendâ€™s birthdays are, and be able to find that information based on their name.
// Create a dictionary (in your file) of names and birthdays. When you run your program it should ask the user to enter a name, 
// and return the birthday of that person back to them. The interaction should look something like this:

// >>> Welcome to the birthday dictionary. We know the birthdays of:
// Albert Einstein
// Benjamin Franklin
// Ada Lovelace
// >>> Who's birthday do you want to look up?
// Benjamin Franklin
// >>> Benjamin Franklin's birthday is 01/17/1706.
